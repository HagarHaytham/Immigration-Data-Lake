# Immigration-Data-Lake

### Data Engineering Capstone Project

  

#### Project Summary

This project aims to gather data of immigrants to the US and analyze it through many aspects, It aims to answer questions like:

- What is the most popular state for the student immigrants ?

- Does the temperature of a state in a certain month affect the number of immigrants?

- How much does the number of immigrants to a state affect the foreigners born in that state ?

And many more analytical questions.

  

The project follows the follow steps:

* Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data

* Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data

* Step 3: Define the Data Model

* Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data

* Step 5: Complete Project Write Up

  

#### Data Gathering

  

The project depends on four datasets.

- The first dataset is the [Immigration Dataset](https://www.trade.gov/national-travel-and-tourism-office) which comes from the US National Tourism and Trade Office. This dataset contains information about the immigrant such as his origin country.
- The second dataset is the [Temperature Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data). This data tells us the temperature of cities monthly. It is wider than the cities of the united states so we have to select only the records that we need.
- The third dataset is the [US cities demographics Dataset](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-cities-demographics/export/) which contains information of each city like how many races live in a city, how many foreigners are born in a city, the population. This dataset can help us study the effect of the immigrants on a state (foreigners born) and also the effect of a state on immigrants (Does immigrants prefer to live in a state with a variety of races or not not for example).
